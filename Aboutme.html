        <p class="h3" >ABOUT ME</p>
        <P>
          My life story goes a little like this <br>
          I grew up(and currently live) in Nairobi-Kenya,<br>
          I started my professional journey immediately after my highschool.and enroll <br>
          as a Business Information Technology student. Through this journey as an information <br>
          technology and a business student. I got interested in programming much compared to business <br>
          and therefore after my graduation. I decided to persue a software development course and here I am. <br>

        </p>
        <p>
          I like programming much because the world now is all about technology <br>
          every sector depends on technology and the joy we encounter today has been <br>
          derived from the heroes who venture in technology, inventing and implementing thoughts <br>
          into reality. Am on entry level but still upgrading everyday.
        </p>
